This is a small test project I put together to learn more about Angular.  It uses a nodejs backend and mongodb for the datastore. If you want to get it up and running just clone the repo and serve it from `http://example.com/time_capturer/`


## TODO
+ ~~Sort the results of the logger in descending order by time and date~~
+ ~~Switch the inputs to store the start and the stop time and the total minutes of the log~~
+ ~~Set up deployment for timecapturer~~
+ Set up Backups for timecapturer
+ Abstract out db backups any datastore needs to have it's own backup scheme
+ User interface:
 + Prefill current client with previous entry,
 +  Make Clients their own object

+ ~~Move domain to subdirectory of main site /time_capturer~~
